The "epa_rental_custom" module was developed specifically for our client who specializes in equipment rental. It adds some enhancements to the sales order form, making the process of managing rental orders more straightforward and user-friendly.

With the changes made, it's now easier to differentiate rental orders from standard sales orders as they're displayed differently in the form. Additionally, fields that are not relevant to rental orders, such as "client_order_ref", "payment_term_id", "sale_order_template_id", and "payment_mode_id", are hidden, making the process of creating and viewing orders more streamlined and efficient.

These changes were made to help our client better manage their equipment rental orders, making the whole process more efficient and user-friendly. The "epa_rental_custom" module allows the client to easily differentiate rental orders from standard sales orders and only displays the fields that are relevant to the equipment rental process.

With these enhancements, the client can manage their rental orders more easily, saving time and making the entire process more efficient. The "epa_rental_custom" module is a customized solution tailored to our client's specific needs, designed to enhance their Odoo experience and productivity.
