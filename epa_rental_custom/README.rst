The `epa_rental_custom` module was developed to meet the needs of our client who works with equipment rental. It adds some customizations to the Odoo sales order form, making the management process of rental orders more efficient and user-friendly.

The changes made by the module include:

- Hiding the "client_order_ref" and "payment_term_id" fields, which are not relevant for rental orders.

- Hiding the "sale_order_template_id" field, which is used to select a sales order template, but for rental orders, a specific sales order template is not needed.

- Hiding the "payment_mode_id" field, which is used to select the payment mode of the order, but for rental orders, the payment mode is usually pre-defined and does not need to be configured.

With these changes, the rental order form becomes simpler and more intuitive, showing only the relevant fields to the user. This helps to make the process of creating and viewing rental orders more efficient and focused on the specific needs of our client who works with equipment rental.
